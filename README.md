# SBND Selection Tool
Takes in trees containing information about reconstructed and true SBND events, generated in LArSoft and written to a single root file. Performs PID and identifies true and reconstructed topologies and true interactions

This file will act as documentation for the repository

# How to run
Fill `run_<name>.C` with the source-code and main file paths in order to compile them in the correct order (based on dependencies) and run the main (put it at the end of the list)

Once this has compiled and you are within ROOT, type the name of the main function to run

# Notes
Everything must be contained within a namespace in order to link correctly
